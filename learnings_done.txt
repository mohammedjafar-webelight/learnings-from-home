List:
  Constructors:
    - empty : Used to create a fixed-length list with all elements initialized to the same value.

    - filled : Creates a list with all elements initialized to the same value. By default, the list is fixed-length, but it can be made growable.

    - from : Used to create a list from an existing iterable or collection.

    - generate : Used to create a list by dynamically generating elements based on a function.

    - of : Used to create a new list from an existing iterable, preserving its elements in the new list.

    - unmodifiable : creates an immutable (read-only) list. Once created, the list cannot be modifiedâ€”no elements can be added, removed, or changed.

  Properties:
    first: Returns the first element of the list, throws an error if the list is empty.

    firstOrNull: Returns the first element if the list is not empty, or null if the list is empty.

    isEmpty: Checks if the list contains no elements, returns true if the list is empty.

    isNotEmpty: Checks if the list contains at least one element, returns true if the list is not empty.

    last: Returns the last element of the list, throws an error if the list is empty.

    lastOrNull: Returns the last element if the list is not empty, or null if the list is empty.

    length: Returns the number of elements in the list.

    nonNulls: Returns an iterable of all non-null elements from the list.

    reversed: Returns an iterable with the elements of the list in reverse order.

    runtimeType: Returns the runtime type of the list (i.e., its type as an object).

    single: Returns the only element of the list if it contains exactly one element, throws an error otherwise.

    singleOrNull: Returns the only element of the list if it contains exactly one element, or null if the list is empty or has more than one element.
